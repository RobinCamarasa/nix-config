# Nix-OS configuration

This is my personal, flake-based NixOS and Home Manager configuration, tailored for multiple systems and focused on reproducibility, modularity, and developer productivity.

## ✨ Features

- **Multi-host support**: Easily switch between different setup
- **Flake-powered**: Declarative and reproducible across environments.
- **Modular Home Manager config**: Cleanly separated into bundles and features.
- **Neovim setup**: Managed in Nix with Lua plugin configuration.
- **Development tools**: Includes git, direnv, tmux, starship, and more.
- **Custom scripts**: Shell utilities for Neovim clipboard, tmux session management, etc.

## 🛠️ Usage

> Prerequisites: Nix flakes enabled.

- Create an envrc with the name of the host as for example:
```bash
export NIXHOST="thinkpad"
```

- Test system config:

```bash
make test ENV=default # change default to the host you want to build
```

- Build & apply system config:

```bash
sudo make rebuild ENV=default # change default to the host you want to build
```

- Clean system:

```bash
sudo make clean
```
